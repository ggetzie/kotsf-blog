It seems\nto be more or less the same regardless of the gender of the group, although\nthese are almost always same-sex groups. The roles are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Leader / The Cool One: Fairly self explanatory. This character sets the\nagenda and mediates disputes between other characters. The other characters\nlook up to them, though they may not always admit it.</li>\n<li>The Brain / The Uptight One: Usually smart, often entrusted to come up with\nthe plan to achieve the goal set by the leader. Sometimes they're just fussy,\nthough.</li>\n<li>The Hothead / The Troubled One: This one, for me, is the most ill-defined and\nvaries the most. Often they have some personal demons they're fighting. If\nthere's a cause or a quest involved they are the most emotionally invested. </li>\n<li>The Goofball / The Free Spirit: Light-hearted and funny, this character\nprovides comic relief. Sometimes they are low-status and serve as the butt of\nother character's jokes, but not always.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There seems to be something about these particular archetypes that form a stable\nand satisfying group dynamic. A functioning group can't have four leaders or\nfour goofballs, nothing would get done. These characters balance each other out\nand support each other. When one's overarching modus operandi is harmful to the\nsituation, the others unite to compensate. When the leader pushes the group too\nhard, the goofball lightens the mood. The Brain comes up with the plans, but\nneeds the others to execute. The Hothead is passionate and fires the group up,\ninspiring them to drive forward towards their goal (Though sometimes the Hothead\ncan go too far. If they perceive the group isn't caring enough and they'll try\nto go off on their own, requiring rescue from the rest of the group).</p>\n<p>I'm focusing here on stories where the group is united in a quest towards some\ncommon goal, which seems to often be the case. If the story is a\n<a href=\"http://amzn.to/1Njhu3L\">Hero's Journey</a>, the leader is often the hero, with the\nrest of the group as support.  The same character types are also evident in more\nopen ended formats where there isn't necessarily a quest - examples below.</p>\n<p>The first place I noticed this was in the movie <em>Stand By Me</em>, as it seems\nparticularly pronounced there:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Leader - Chris</li>\n<li>The Brain - Gordie</li>\n<li>The Hothead - Teddy</li>\n<li>The Goofball - Vern</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Stand By Me</em> is interesting because it's <em>about</em> (so to speak) The Brain, in\nthat he's the narrator. Usually if there's a main character, it's The Leader,\nbut much of the time all four characters share the focus equally. Some other\nfour character ensembles where this dynamic plays out:</p>\n<h4>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</h4>\n<p>Also very obvious, and probably a better canonical example than <em>Stand By Me</em>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Leader - Leonardo</li>\n<li>The Brain - Donatello</li>\n<li>The Hothead - Raphael</li>\n<li>The Goofball - Michelangelo </li>\n</ul>\n<p> I've heard tell that some people consider Raphael the leader. Unfortunately,\nthose people are wrong.</p>\n<h4>Ghostbusters</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The Leader - Peter Venkman</li>\n<li>The Brain - Egon Spengler</li>\n<li>The Hothead - Winston Zeddmore</li>\n<li>The Goofball - Ray Stantz</li>\n</ul>\n<p> This is a less than perfect example. Winston is The Hothead mostly by the\nprocess of elmination. If Ghostbusters has a failing, it's how underdeveloped\nthe character of Winston is, compared to the other three. It will be\ninteresting to see how the new Ghostbusters handles the Winston-equivalent\ncharacter. Speaking of groups of women, they hold to more or less the same\ndynamic.</p>\n<h4>Sex and the City</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The Leader - Carrie</li>\n<li>The Brain - Charlotte</li>\n<li>The Hothead - Miranda</li>\n<li>The Goofball - Samantha</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To be honest, I haven't seen a whole lot of this show and I'm not sure I have\nthis right. One could make an argument for switching Charlotte and\nMiranda. Samantha is much more on the \"Free Spirit\" side of Goofball / Free\nSpirit type. The Goofball's role is to push the group to lighten up and take\nthings less seriously and sometimes provide comic relief. A lot of the time this\nis accomplished by The Goofball character being naive and innocent, almost\nchildlike. Samantha is an interesting departure in that she accomplishes this\npurpose while being decidedly <em>not</em> innocent.</p>\n<h4>Girls</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The Leader - Hannah</li>\n<li>The Brain - Marnie</li>\n<li>The Hothead - Jessa</li>\n<li>The Goofball - Shoshanna</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This one puzzled me for a bit. I wanted Jessa to be the free spirit, since that\nis the way she seems to view herself. By season 2 though, it becomes obvious\nthat Jessa isn't as carefree as she appears, and that is mostly an act to cover\nup her personal struggles. Shoshanna, on the other hand, is charmingly naive\nsometimes, dispensing wisdom in a from-the-mouths-of-babes type way. She plays\nThe Fool, who, because of her innocence, can get away with acknowledging truths\nthe other characters know, but delude themselves into ignoring.</p>\n<h4>Seinfeld</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The Leader - Jerry</li>\n<li>The Brain - Elaine</li>\n<li>The Hothead - George</li>\n<li>The Goofball - Kramer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Seinfeld fits so well I have to think it's deliberate. George flies off the\nhandle on the regular. A whole episode is devoted to Elaine retaking an IQ test\nto prove how smart she is. Kramer is, well, Kramer. It's also a somewhat rare\nexample of a mixed-gender group. Way to be progressive, Seinfeld!</p>\n<p>This seems to be a remarkably robust dynamic. It holds true even in larger\ngroups, where more than one character may combine to fill the same role. Take\n<em>Lord of the Rings</em>, for example - many more than four characters, yet they fit\nthe same archetypes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Leader - Frodo, Sam</li>\n<li>The Brain - Gandalf, Legolas, Aragorn</li>\n<li>The Hothead - Gimli</li>\n<li>The Goofball - Merry and Pippin</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a variation, The Hothead is sometimes optional. If the characters are\nsufficiently motivated by their situation and/or if the story is too\nlight-hearted to support someone who's dark and brooding, it's not necessary to\nembody that aspect in a character. <em>Harry Potter</em> is the most obvious example of\na three person dynamic.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Leader - Harry</li>\n<li>The Brain - Hermione</li>\n<li>The Goofball - Ron</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I don't think the story would have been improved by the addition of a fourth\nHothead character to the main group. The direness of the impending doom of\nVoldemort taking over the world is sufficient to inspire the characters to move\nforward. Harry also does some double-duty by having brooding, troubled episodes\nat times.</p>\n<p>Clearly, I could go on indefinitely analyzing how various different character\ngroups fit into this mold, as it's a lot of fun to me. I doubt it's perfect and\nprobably someone will be able to point out an example where it doesn't\nhold. Still, I think it provides a good framework for how characters can\ninteract with each other in a way that is satisfying to watch. Definitely\nsomething to keep in mind and play with if I ever write something about a group\nof characters.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2015-08-15","path":"/the-four-c-archetype/","title":"The Four Character Group Archetype"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"KotSF"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
