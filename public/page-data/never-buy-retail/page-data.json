In doing so I think I've come up with a good\nway to tell how likely a particular purchase is to be a waste. For everything\nyou buy, look at the amount of value you have to add <em>yourself</em> before it\nbecomes useful. If you don't add anything of your own, and consume it\nimmediately, this means it's been marked up the maximum possible amount, that is\nto say, you're spending the most amount of money to obtain it.</p>\n<p>Let's look at food for example. On one end of the scale you can go to a nice\nrestaurant. From the moment you walk in the door, you're whisked to a comfy\ntable and several real, live human beings will run about, fetching anything you\nmight desire, fully prepared and ready to eat. At the end of the meal, you've\ncontributed nothing but consumption. The staff of course will clean up after\nyou.</p>\n<p>To step it down a notch, you can go to a slightly less fancy restaurant. You\nmight have to go up to a counter and carry the food <em>all by yourself</em> to the\ntable. It's not much, but it's something. Chances are you'll receive some minor\ncompensation for this effort in the form of lower prices.</p>\n<p>You can extend this concept all the way down the <em>ahem</em> food chain. TV dinners,\nfresh cooked meals, growing your own vegetables, etc. I'm not necessarily\nadvocating that everyone start a farm in their back yard, but it's helpful to\nconsider how you might trade a little effort for keeping some more of your money\nby bringing your own value to things you consume.</p>\n<p>Another good example is housing. My own city, Washington, DC, has been going\nthrough a bit of a population boom over the past several years. As a result the\nreal estate listing are littered with gems like\n<a href=\"http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1346-Otis-Pl-NW-Washington-DC-20010/472828_zpid/\">this one</a>. First,\nnotice that the listing price is over <strong>$370,000</strong> above Zillow's estimated value,\nbased on the amounts comparable homes in the area have sold for. Scroll down a\nlittle more and you'll see the home last sold for nearly <em>half</em> the asking\nprice, and that less than 3 months ago. Clicking through the pictures, it's\nplain to see the seller did an outstanding job renovating this place into a\nmodel of modern luxury. Of course, they expect to be compensated accordingly. All\nthat value will be transferred from the buyer to the seller in the form of cold,\nhard cash. What's left then for the buyer? We all like to think of homes as\ninvestments, but in this case they've essentially just bought a product. All\nthey can do is hope that people as rich as themselves keep flooding into the\ncity to buy overpriced homes. There's no opportunity here to add value\nthemselves.</p>\n<p>This year, and beyond, I'm going to look for more opportunities to add my own\nvalue wherever possible. Buy more raw materials, fewer finished products. As a\nhappy side effect I'll also get to learn new skills and get an end result that's\ncustomized to my exact specifications. Seems like a win all around to me.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2015-01-18","path":"/never-buy-retail/","title":"Never Buy Retail"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"KotSF"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
