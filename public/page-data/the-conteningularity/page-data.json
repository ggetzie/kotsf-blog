How did you\nget entertainment? Typically, you had to drive to a store pay some not\ninsubstantial amount of money, then drive back home and watch your movie or read\nyour book. If you rented the movie, you'd have to drive back again to return\nit. If you wanted to read a newspaper, you had to do the same or arrange a\nsubscription to have it delivered to your house. Even then, once you finished\nreading it (this might take an hour or two, to peruse everything that interested\nyou), that was it. There wouldn't be another one until tomorrow. Likewise with\nmagazines, except you'd have to wait a whole week or even a month for\nthose. Basically, there was a physical limit to how much entertainment you could\nconsume at anyone time. TV, was always there of course, but you were limited to\nwhatever the networks had decided to program at that time. Over time cable\noptions grew and suddenly there were hundreds of channels providing\nentertainment options 24 hours a day. Still, once you flipped through all those\nchannels, you were left with whatever as on, and there was a good chance that\nnone of it interested you.</p>\n<p>The Internet came along and changed all this. Suddenly, there was a world of\ninformation at your fingertips. In the beginning, (I'm referring to the early 90s\nhere and the advent of widespread consumer Internet. I'm sure many of you are\nscoffing heartily about how everything started much much earlier than that) the\nInternet too was fairly limited. Information was sparse and of unknown\nprovenance. The main draw was the ability to connect to real live people all\nover the world who wanted to talk about whatever you wanted to talk about at the\nmoment.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the present day. As Internet speeds have grown and search\nfunctionality has improved it is now possible to obtain practically any piece of\nmedia that has ever existed at a moment's notice. Entertainment used to be a\nfairly scarce resource. You had to make do with what you could get, when you\ncould get it, and figure out yourself what to do the rest of the time. Right\nnow, thanks to Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and the like most of us lucky enough\nto be living in the developed world have access to more entertainment than we\ncan consume in a lifetime at any moment. We are living in a post-scarcity\nentertainment economy, and I don't think the entertainment industry has caught\non to this yet.</p>\n<p>Netflix, for example, supposedly has at least a petabyte of video stored. If\nthis were relatively uncompressed HD video at 8 GB/hour (it's not), that's\n125,000 hours of video. At the 4 hours per day of TV watching the average\nAmerican does (so we're told), this is 85 years worth of content. Granted, not\nall of it is necesarily going to be of interest to any one person, but this is a\nfairly low estimate, and that's only the content on one service. Once you add\nthe books available through your Kindle, the other video services, YouTube,\nblogs, news sites, music streaming services, etc, it's fair to say that the\naverage person has available to them at any given time, enough entertainment to\nlast a lifetime. And still, there's more being created every day.</p>\n<p>This isn't to say that we should stop. People will continue creating art,\nregardless, of how much of it there is, for the same reason they always have:\nbecause there is a truth inside them that they need to communicate to other\npeople. This is a worthwhile endeavor, and I think it should be encouraged. What\nI <em>do</em> think is going to happen is that the current entertainment industry and\nthe profits it generates, are unsustainable. Imagine what would happen to the\nprice of oil if everyone suddenly had an oil well in their living room that\ncould generate a lifetime worth of oil on demand. That's about what the\nsituation is with entertainment. The demand for the kind of\ngive-your-mind-a-rest, just sit and consume for an hour or two entertainment is\nfairly permanently filled. Every new piece of entertainment has to compete not\nonly with whatever else is on at the time, but with everything that has ever\nexisted to that point. This is a great time to be an entertainment consumer, but\nI think it's going to be pretty lousy to be an entertainment producer.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2015-01-08","path":"/the-conteningularity/","title":"The Content Singularity"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"KotSF"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
