I don't think there's a good way to\ntalk about that without sounding like I'm bragging, but there it is. The thing\nis, I didn't really get <em>why</em> people thought I was smart. None of the things I\nthought seemed particularly extraordinary to me, yet people insisted they were\nexceptional in some way. As a result being a \"smart person\" became a large part\nof my identity. This helped in some ways, and hurt in others. I won't go into a\ngreat amount of detail, but suffice to say reading about <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1kHHniB\">Carol Dweck's research</a>\ninto growth mindsets versus fixed mindsets felt like reading my own biography,\nas I'm sure it has for many formerly \"gifted\" children. </p>\n<p>Anyway, that's not what I want to talk about right now. The point is, I've spent\na lot of time thinking about what \"smart\" means, and what exactly our minds are\ndoing when it comes to this thing we call intelligence. After 30 some years, I\nthink I've maybe started to get a handle on it.</p>\n<h3>What is it?</h3>\n<p>Let's say you see something you've never seen before. What's the first thing you\nmight ask? It's probably something along the lines of \"What is it?\". It's a\nquestion so simple most people probably wouldn't give it a second thought, but\nit exposes an important assumption we all make every day. This thing, whatever\nit is, does not exist on its own. It is an instance of a class of things. </p>\n<p>This is, in a way, kind of odd. Here we have a vast universe with immense\namounts of matter swirling around and bumping into itself and combining together\nand breaking apart in various ways over time. Why should any two clumps of\nmatter resemble each other except by chance? Yet, they do, of course. Not only\nthat, but they do so reliably that the lumps of matter in our heads respond in\npredictable ways, creating thoughts that correspond to these phenomena.</p>\n<p>General purpose thinking algorithm.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sense a thing.  </li>\n<li>Extract features*  </li>\n<li>Compare features to other known things.  </li>\n<li>Place things with matching features in a group.  </li>\n<li>Extrapolate additional features based on features present on other things in the group.  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Failures of this method:<br>\nCargo cults.\nRacism/Sexism.<br>\nReligion: aka - cargo cults.</p>\n<p>Successes:<br>\nScience.</p>\n<p>The difference between failure and success is the rigor with which we include\nthings in groups and our willingness to re-evaluate a thing's membership in a\ngroup based on new information.</p>\n<p>Groups are inherently fictitious. The group is a construct of the mind. Flawed\nreasoning supposes causality flows from group to individual rather than from\nindividual to group.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>With apologies to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015DWJ8W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;camp=1789&#x26;creative=390957&#x26;creativeASIN=B0015DWJ8W&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;tag=greater0c-20&#x26;linkId=NPJPCCPUYE7GZZBE\">Haruki Murakami</a></p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">â†©</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"date":"2016-01-24","path":"/draft/how-we-think/","title":"What I think about when I think about thinking[^1] Part 1"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"KotSF"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
