I'm not talking about kidnapping. Look at North Korea, for\nexample. All available evidence indicates that it's an absolutely\nhorrible place to live. I wonder how many of the people living there\nwould leave given the chance? What if the US just parked some ships\noff the coast or set up some camps along the border and granted\ncitizenship to anyone who wanted it?</p>\n<p>Countries depend on having an ample supply of working age men and\nwomen to help drive their economies. When the working age citizens\nstart to get outnumbered by the children and the elderly, the country\ncan get into deep demographic trouble as the producers of resources\nget outnumbered by the consumers. Malcolm Gladwell\n<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/08/28/060828fa_fact\">explains the phenomenon</a>\nin an excellent article.</p>\n<p>Supposing this radical immigration plan were put into action, who\nwould be the most likely people to take it up? It would likely be\nyoung, working age people; the very same people countries depend on to\nproduce the goods and services that drive their economies. Every\neconomicaly productive person that America lures from elsewhere is a\nboon to America and a blow to the country they come from. Every time a\nworker leaves, the ratio of working to non-working citizens worsens.</p>\n<p>This isn't about trying to destroy a certain country, per\nse. Countries should be subjected to the same economic forces that\ncompanies are. Is our way of life so great? If it is, how many people\nwould choose it? By freeing people to make these choices we can see\nmore easily which country is the most desirable. Decrease the friction\nfor people to move among countries and the countries that don't treat\ntheir citizens well will wither and die.</p>\n<p>lThis strategy is not without its risks. Cuba for example,\n<a href=\"http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/mariel-boatlift.htm\">deliberately deported</a>\nhundreds of criminals to the US during a mass migration.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2016-01-24","path":"/draft/stealing-a-country/","title":"Stealing a Country"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"KotSF"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
