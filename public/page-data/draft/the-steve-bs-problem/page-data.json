It inspired me to write <a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4282354\">this comment</a> on Hacker News and since then it's become one of those ideas that just kind of worms its way into your head and gestates there. The question it's made me curious about is something I'm going to call The Steve Jobs Problem. The Problem is specific to people who succeed in creative endeavors, the fields where taste and a keen sense of design are the key factors for success. The Problem is, why are the people at the tops of these fields often huge assholes?</p>\n<p>Now, I should qualify that. Unfortunately, I don't have any conclusive data to indicate that this is necessarily the case. I'm basing this mainly on the fact that it's a cliche. It's not general to ALL creative people, in particular this applies to creative people who are <em>in charge of</em> other people. Steve Jobs is an obvious famous example, but you could also name Anna Wintour (editor-in-chief of <em>Vogue</em>, the subject of the movie <em>The Devil Wears Prada</em>) and Cecil B. DeMille (film director<a href=\"#fn1\">[1]</a>), and Stanley Kubrick, another director. Anyway, I hope we can agree that this is a well established stereotype/trope/cliche, whatever you want to call it.</p>\n<p>I should also be more specific. \"is a huge asshole\" is a pretty broad description. The role these people play is to look at things that others have created, and decide if they're any good or not. When they find that these things are not good, they are very vocal about it, and very caustic. They belittle and berate the person who brought it to them and declare it very nearly the end of the world. This behavior can often extend to situations outside of their professional room, such as Steve Jobs being served a meal he doesn't like, or Anna Wintour encountering her assistant wearing a dress she finds ugly. The reaction other people have to this behavior is often to shake their heads and mutter \"Jesus, what an asshole\". </p>\n<p>Now, hardly anybody denies that Steve Jobs was a genius at what he did. He didn't do a lot of the actual design work. He didn't create the mock-ups himself. Yet nobody doubts that Apple wouldn't be where it is without him. The most common criticism is something along the lines of \"Yes, yes, it's great that he could do what he did, but why couldn't he just be <em>nicer</em>?\" In this there is the implicit assumption that niceness and critical ability are two mutually exclusive things. What if they aren't? I think the same mechanism that makes a person good at expressing the sense of taste that made Steve Jobs famous, also makes them likely to have caustic outbursts in the face of things they find distasteful.</p>\n<p>In order to </p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong><a name=\"fn1\">1</a></strong> I'm pretty sure he's the inspiration for those Warner Bros. cartoons where Daffy Duck is a director and becomes furious, stomping his director's chair into the ground. Actually, come to think of it, Looney Toons are probably responsible for a lot of what we consider to be \"common knowledge\". That's a subject worth exploring on its own sometime</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2016-01-24","path":"/draft/the-steve-bs-problem/","title":"The Steve Jobs Problem"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"KotSF"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
