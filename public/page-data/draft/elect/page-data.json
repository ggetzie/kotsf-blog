Seriously, I feel\nlike I just woke up from the matrix. I'm still reeling and trying to process\neverything that's happened. I didn't get it until after Trump won. I think a lot\nof people still haven't gotten it. In the meantime I wrote this little\nfable. It's not a true story, at least I don't think it is. I don't have any\nevidence to say that it is. But there's just enough coincidences to think that\nmaybe, possibly, it might be.</p>\n<p>Once upon a time there was a young woman named Hillary Rodham. She was very\nsmart and very ambitious and very idealistic. She grew up in Illinois, in a\nsuburb of Chicago and she decided that she wanted to help people, as much as she\ncould, for her whole life. She studied hard and went to a very good college and\nfrom there to a very good law school. After that, she decided to move to\nArkansas, because that's where some of the poorest people were, who needed the\nmost help. She worked as a public defender and spoke for people who had no\nvoice. She fought to get healthcare for children who didn't have any. Along the\nway she met a charming man named Bill and they fell in love and got married.</p>\n<p>Bill was also very smart, and very idealistic, and very charismatic and\nambitious. Together they decided that they could help even more people if they\nwent into politics. Bill started running for office, and he started winning.</p>\n<p>But running for office is very expensive. Soon Hillary and Bill decided that\nthey couldn't do it alone. They needed more money. So they went to find some\nwealthy Donors who could help them out. They approached some Donors and told\nthem about all the wonderful things they wanted to do to help people. The Donors\nsaid \"That sounds wonderful! We'll help you do these great things. But, by the\nway, there's a few other things too. Don't worry too much about them. They'll\nhelp us create more jobs for everyone!\"</p>\n<p>Well, Bill and Hillary were never business people, but creating jobs sounded\ngood. So they went ahead and they won more elections and they helped more people\nand before you knew it, Bill was running for President of the United States.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, elections kept getting more and more expensive. And the Donors\nkept asking for more and more favors. Hillary and Bill, being very smart,\nstarted studying up on the things the Donors were asking for, and they started\nthinking that maybe these wouldn't create so many jobs after all, and maybe\nthese were not so helpful to all the people they wanted to help. They decided\nthat maybe they didn't want to help do these things any more.</p>\n<p>This made the Donors very angry. \"If you won't do it, we'll find someone who\nwill! And <em>maybe</em> they'll want to undo all the helpful things you've done so\nfar!\" The Donors went so far as to arrange for Bill to be impeached. Bill, you\nsee, while being very smart and very kind, was flawed, as all humans are. The\nDonors knew this and exploited those flaws as best they could to try to turn the\npeople against him and Hillary. Hillary had had enough. She tried to speak\nout. She told the people of a \"vast conspiracy\" against her and Bill. But, the\nDonors owned the newspapers and the TV stations. When they wrote what she said,\nthey just laughed at her, and so everyone else did too. Bill managed to escape\nthe impeachment, somehow more popular than ever. But the damage was done. When\nBill and Hillary tried to send their friend Al to carry on their work, the\nDonors sent two of their own to run against them. When the Donors lost the\nelection, they used all their resources to put their candidate in office\nanyway. A dark time followed. </p>\n<p>For eight long years the Donors reigned, through wars and economic\nturmoil. Finally, Hillary got another chance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/6o5GxmMIbok?t=1m28s\">\"Part of the beauty of me, is that I'm very rich\"</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2016-11-20","path":"/draft/elect/","title":"This Election"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"KotSF"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
