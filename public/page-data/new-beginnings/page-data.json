Suffice it to say, the site never\nreally gained much traction, except maybe among a small, but\ndedicated group of spammers. I guess the demand for a site\nspecifically tailored for arguing on the Internet is not as high\nas I had thought. Perhaps people are content to argue on the many\nsites where it is only an ancilliary function. Perhaps I didn't\nmarket as effectively as I could have. Probably some combination\nof the above, and other factors.</p>\n<p>At any rate, I want to free up the space on the server for new\nendeavors, including this blog. The old posts from <em>That's\nDebatable</em> have been ported to here and will remain accessible in\nperpetutity in their own <a href=\"/gdarchive\">archive</a>. Meanwhile, I will\nplunge forward under the rebranded title you see now. I'm also\nwriting some new software to make the blog happen. I think the\ndatabase/web framework setup is somewhat overkill for my simple\nblog. It also favors writing in a web form, which I never\nliked. To that end the new blog is statically hosted, with some\nsimple scripts to convert markdown text to html, pass them through\na template and save to the web server root directly. The whole\nthing is pushed to site with mercurial, which makes the workflow\nnice for me. It also means I get to do all the writing in emacs,\nand who wouldn't want that?</p>\n<p>Aside from simplifying my blog life, I have another new project\nthat has been smoldering on the back burner for a couple years\nnow. It's time to finally bring that to the fore, so lookout for\nmore on that soon.</p>\n<p>I hope everyone's new year is off to a great start. See you soon!</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2015-01-02","path":"/new-beginnings/","title":"New Beginnings"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"KotSF"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
