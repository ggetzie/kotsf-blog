Every guide to controlling your budget usually starts with\nthis. However, there's not a lot of guidance in deciding between one and the\nother. A lot of the reason there's not is probably that this is a very personal\nprocess. What one person considers a frivolity, another person might consider a\nnecessity. It's up to each of us to decide what things we value and then shift\nour budgets accordingly to prioritize spending where it counts and avoid things\nwe can do without.</p>\n<p>In the new year, I'm going to try implementing a new system. In reviewing my\nexpenses from the last year, I've decided to assign them each a priority level\nof 1-5 based on the criteria below. I don't expect everyone would have the same\nvalues as I do in regards of how to prioritize spending, but I think simply\nlabelling things neccessary or unnecessary is too coarse to be useful. Instead,\nI'm going to try to be more mindful of what purpose I'm trying to achieve with\neach purchase.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Survive - Necessary for survival: This includes things like rent, utilities,\ngroceries that I need to stay alive. I'm also including Internet access and\nmobile phone service. While I technically could live without them, it's pretty\ntough to have any sort of normal, modern life without these.</li>\n<li>Prosper - Not strictly necessary, but beneficial: Honestly, this is probably\nthe most ill-defined category. Here I'm including things that I don't really\n<em>need</em>, but which provide a practical benefit that I deem greater than the\ncost. Things like furniture, new clothes, my car and all its related expenses,\nand soon a cleaning service. These expenses make life easier and provide me more\ntime to do things I like, but if I absolutely had to, I could get rid of them.</li>\n<li>Connect - Fun with friends: These expenses are, in a sense, unnecessary, but they\ninvolve building relationships with friends and family and for that reason I\nvalue them higher than things which only entertain myself. This includes things\nlike eating at restaurants, having drinks with friends, gifts, and travel to\nvisit friends and family.</li>\n<li>Enjoy - Fun alone: These are things that I enjoy, but don't really need. This\nincludes entertainment that I only use by myself or conveniences that I could\nhave avoided with better planning. Examples are tv services (netflix, etc.),\nbooks to read for pleasure, eating out for lunch or getting coffee at work,\ntake-out food. I really don't need to buy these things, but at least I got some\nenjoyment out of them.</li>\n<li>Avoid - Waste, Mistakes: These are things I didn't want to spend money on and\nthat could have been avoided. This includes things like speeding tickets,\nparking tickets, repairs to things damaged by negligence or carelessness,\netc. This category <em>should</em> be zero. That will be the goal for 2016.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So how did I do last year? I went through and ranked every purchase I made by\nadding a number one through five as a note in Mint. I then exported the data\nfrom mint and used a little <a href=\"http://pandas.pydata.org/\">pandas</a> magic to tally\nup the totals for each priority and draw a little pie chart with\n<a href=\"http://matplotlib.org/\">matplotlib</a>. This would be pretty easy to do in Excel\ntoo, but I like using any chance to practice data munging with python. Anyway,\nthe results came out like this.</p>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 576px;\">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/0f535f90855c2be68316b8816255464b/9b31d/priorities.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"priorities\" title=\"priorities\" src=\"/static/0f535f90855c2be68316b8816255464b/9b31d/priorities.png\" srcset=\"/static/0f535f90855c2be68316b8816255464b/19bd1/priorities.png 163w,\n/static/0f535f90855c2be68316b8816255464b/d3bcb/priorities.png 325w,\n/static/0f535f90855c2be68316b8816255464b/9b31d/priorities.png 576w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n<p>Overall, I think not too bad. Things are probably a <em>little</em> higher and the\n\"Connect\" side of things, but that can be remedied by relying less on having to\ngo out to eat or get drinks as an excuse to hang out with friends (or maybe\nordering cheaper drinks when I do). I really thought \"Enjoy\" would be a bigger\nproblem than it was. It seems like I give in a lot to the urge to just go out\nfor lunch at work, or pay $2-$3 for that afternoon cup of coffee rather than\ngrabbing one from the office machine. Still, this number could probably be cut\nat least in half. Maybe I'll immediately transfer money to savings instead of\nbuying that cup of afternoon coffee as an incentive to save the money rather\nthan spend it.</p>\n<p>Of course, this isn't intended to be the end-all/be-all method of prioritizing\nspending. Within each priority there are opportunities to save money. You need\nsomewhere to live to survive, but that can be a studio apartment or a mansion,\nwith accordingly different impacts on the budget. There are also multiple ways\nto achieve each goal without spending any money. This was a helpful exercise for\nme to think about what I value, and to make sure I'm spending money in line with\nthose values.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2016-01-03","path":"/how-necesse-expenses/","title":"How Necessary Are Those Expenses?"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"KotSF"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
