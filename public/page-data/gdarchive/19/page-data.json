When someone posted a link to a\n<a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/e81go/ufo_dataset/\">dataset of UFO sighting information</a>\non Reddit, it seemed as good an opportunity as any to jump in and get\nmy feet wet. There's a lot that could be done with this data, but to\nstart I decided to make a heat map indicating the number of sightings\nby county, throughout the US.</p>\n<p>With the help of\n<a href=\"http://flowingdata.com/2009/11/12/how-to-make-a-us-county-thematic-map-using-free-tools/\">this excellent guide</a>\nover at Flowing Data, this didn't seem too hard at all. The only\nhiccup was that I needed to determine the county and state from the\nlocation field in the data. For the most part, I was able to stitch\ntogether data from several other datasets to resolve the city and\nstate format of the location field into the county and state\ninformation needed to locate the sighting on the map. Unfortunately,\nthis narrowed down the data from around 63000 sightings to around 43000.\nFor the records where no county and state could be identified,\nmost were either outside the US, or the city name was not connected to\na county name in any of the datasets I dug up. Obviously, having a\nmore comprehensive listing of all city names in the US along with the\ncorresponding county in which they reside would be helpful, but\nworking with free data, you take what you can get.</p>\n<p>Another confounding factor was that the location field was somewhat\nnoisy and non-uniform. The location might be something like \"New York\nCity, NY\" (which would be ideal as this could be split on the comma\ninto city and state) or it might say something like \"Las Vegas (side\nof the highway north of town), NV\" which fails when simply split on\nthe comma, so even though that particular city and state would be in\nmy data, it wouldn't be identified. I was able to improve the rate at\nwhich counties were correctly identified a little by removing all\nparenthetical remarks, and special-casing any location that already\nhad the word \"county\" in it.</p>\n<p>But anyway, without any further ado. Let's have a look at the map.

The\nstereotypical idea of a UFO sighting, at least in my mind, is of\nsomeone all alone on a dark road out in the middle of nowhere, and is\nalso associated with more rural populations. However, it seems like\nthe more people there are are in a given area, the more likely it is,\nrougly, that some of them have seen, or thought they saw, a UFO.</p>\n<p>I think there's a good deal of information to be mined. I'd also like\nto get around to seeing if there's any particular day of the week or\ntime of year when sightings are more prevalent. Maybe Friday and\nSaturday nights when people are more likely to have been drinking? It\nwould also be interesting to not if there's any similarities in\ndescription based on sightings that take place around the same time,\nor in the same place.</p>\n<p>If you're interested, you can find all the datasets I used to patch together the data for this analysis at the following locations:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://infochimps.com/datasets/d60000-documented-ufo-sightings-with-text-descriptions-and-metad\">UFO Dataset</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://infochimps.com/datasets/united-states-zip-code-database-postal-code-latitudelongitude-ci\">US towns and zip codes</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/places2k.html\">US county and FIPS code data</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:USA_Counties_with_FIPS_and_names.svg\">Blank USA County map</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/co-codes/states.txt\">All county FIPs codes</a>  </p>\n<p>If you'd like to see the code I used to create the map, it's available on my <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/ggetzie/ufo-data-code\">bitbucket account</a>. The numerical FIPs codes ended up being unnecessary, so it's a little more convoluted than I might like, but it works well enough I suppose.</p>\n<p><em>Originally published 2011-01-24 06:29:01</em></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2011-01-24","path":"/gdarchive/19","title":"The UFO Sightings US Heat Map"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"KotSF"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
