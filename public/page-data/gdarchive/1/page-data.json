I guess this is the part where I talk about the sorts of things I intend to be posting here. For the time being, I'm planning on using this as a catchall blog for everything I want to write about. I suppose time will tell if this is the best idea or not. On the GreaterDebater front, I'd like to blog about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New and in-development features for GreaterDebater. Feedback is always appreciated.</li>\n<li>Some of how GreaterDebater works and things I've learned along the way. Hopefully someone can learn from my mistakes and blind alleys.</li>\n<li>Any other GreaterDebater news and announcements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On a more general note, I'm going to blog about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Other projects, unrelated to GreaterDebater. I have some ideas I hope to start working on soon.</li>\n<li>Reviews of books, movies, video games and other media.</li>\n<li>Anything else that comes to mind that I think might start some interesting discussion (either in the comments here or at GreaterDebater).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So there it is! Now to get started on a non-metablogging blog post.</p>\n<p><em>Originally published 2010-02-01 12:00:04</em></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2010-02-01","path":"/gdarchive/1","title":"Introducing That's Debatable"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"KotSF"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
