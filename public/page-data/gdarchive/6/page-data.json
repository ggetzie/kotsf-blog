On the whole, these work pretty well. The top rated stories and\ncomments are often the most interesting, or at least the most\namusing. It seems that there is always a certain level of disagreement\nabout the proper voting etiquette though. Inevitably something gets\nvoted to the top that some people feel should not have been. Said\npeople make their feelings known, trying to educate everyone else on\nwhy this story shouldn't be at the top. Better stories belong\nthere. Presumably, the ones that they themselves like.</p>\n<p>Sure, these sites have guidelines to explain how and when you should\nvote. In a perfect world, everyone would read and abide by\nthem. Unfortunately people have their own conceptions of when they\nshould vote things up or down. Here's a partial list of my own reasons:</p>\n<p><strong>Up</strong>  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>It made me laugh</li>\n<li>It answered the question the post was asking</li>\n<li>It already said what I opened the comments to say</li>\n<li>It makes a good point and I agree with it</li>\n<li>I don't agree with it, but it makes a good point</li>\n<li>It sounds like it will generate some interesting discussion, so I want more people to see it.</li>\n<li>I enjoyed it and I wish its makers success, so I want to contribute to giving it publicity.</li>\n<li>Mostly, it made me laugh</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Down</strong>  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>It's incorrect</li>\n<li>It's abusive</li>\n<li>It's harmful <em>e.g. telling a new Linux user to run rm -rf /</em></li>\n<li>I don't agree with it, and its point is made poorly</li>\n<li>I'm bored of seeing this sort of thing</li>\n<li>It failed to make me laugh</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I imagine most people have similar lists of reasons for voting the way\nthey do. Some of the reasons are good according to the site standards,\nsome are not. (Of course there's also always the people who decide \"I\njust submitted a story so I'll vote everyone else's story down, so\nmine is relatively more popular)</p>\n<p>I don't think any of these reasons are bad. No doubt everybody else\nfeels the same way about their own list of reasons for voting the way\nthey do. However, this leaves some confusion for what it means to be\nvoted to the top on one of these sites. Was your link or comment the\nfunniest? The most insightful? The one everyone agrees with? It could\nbe any of these, or all, or none.</p>\n<p>On GreaterDebater topics are sorted by the rate at which they are\naccruing new comments. Writing a comment is a little more involved\nthan simply voting, so the topics at the top are\nthose that most inspire conversation. This way the main metric used for\nsorting topics is their level of engagement. </p>\n<p>Does this contradict the decision to use voting to determine the\noutcomes of debates? I don't think so. The decision to cast a vote for\none or the other participant in a debate is a lot less ambiguous than\nthe one to vote a topic up or down. The voting system for debates may\nyet prove to have it's own set of perils but they likely won't involve\nthe promotion of uninteresting debates.</p>\n<p>Longer comments have a greater impact on the ranking of a topic than\nshorter ones. Comment length is not necessarily an indicator of\nquality, but it is often correlated. For instance, it does tend to\nindicate the amount of thought put into a comment. Topics that inspire\nfewer thoughtful comments will rise faster than those that only accrue\nshort \"me too\" style comments.</p>\n<p>Of course, not all comments will be in support of a topic. Sometimes people will leave a comment to express their dissatisifaction or disagreement with a particular issue. I don't think this is a problem though when it comes to the possibility of having a topic with which many people disagree at the top of the list. As long as it inspires disagreement that creates interesting discussion, there should be no complaints about a topic's position. It's quite often that I end up learning more from the comments on social news sites than I do from the articles themselves. I hope to encourage that same atmosphere here at GreaterDebater.</p>\n<p>In general, I think the best way to find out how someone feels about something is to look at what they do, whenever possible, rather than ask them directly about it. In retrospect it's pretty simple. Rather than ask people which topics they find most engaging, simply look at the ones that they're most engaged with.</p>\n<p><em>Originally published 2010-02-22 06:54:34</em></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2010-02-22","path":"/gdarchive/6","title":"Why there are no up or down arrows on GreaterDebater"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"KotSF"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
