I read\nsomewhere once that all the successful blogs have a niche. \"You've got to stick\nto one topic and be the expert on it\", they say \"So your audience knows what to\nexpect\".  This has always been a sticking point with me, although I see it borne\nout in successful blogs by people who don't already have a\nfollowing. Regardless, I don't intend to stick to one thing. There's a lot of\nthings I'm interested in. As a result some posts will probably not be interest\nto people who were interested in other posts. Ah, well. Such is life. Here's a\nshort, non-comprehensive list of things I may or may not write about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Philosophy - to include general thoughts on the meaning of life and the nature\nof reality, ethics, metaphysics, aesthetics, all that jazz.</li>\n<li>Personal finance - to the extreme. Such as how to retire early (or at least\nsteps I am taking in that direction, as I certainly can't speak from\nexperience. Yet.)</li>\n<li>Programming - in particular, python, django, javascript</li>\n<li>Machine learning / data science / Artificial Intelligence - This ties into\nthe philosophy thing. I'm fascinated by how our minds work and how we can\nreplicate them in software.</li>\n<li>TV / Movie / Literary criticism - Not in any real serious way, but I read a\nlot, and watch maybe slightly more TV and movies than the next person. I have\nthoughts about them. I like to share them with people.</li>\n<li>Politics, Current Events, Economics - Like anyone, I have opinions. Except\nmine are right ;)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, if any of those things are interest to you stick around! You'll be sure to\nfind something you like sooner or later.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"KotSF"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":true}}}
