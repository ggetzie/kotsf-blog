At least that is if you watched the\nevening news. Every night at 6 and 11 you'd be apprised of a new mortal danger,\nlurking just around the corner. Sometimes it would even be <em>within your own\nhome</em>. You'll hear all about it, after this commercial break.</p>\n<p>The ratings wars among local TV newscasts had by this time long come to a\nhead. Stations had found that by far the most effective way to garner viewers\nwas to appeal to emotional instincts. Namely, fear. What thing lurking in your\nhome can kill you? You clearly need to know. It's a matter of life or death! How\ncould you <em>not</em> stay tuned until after the next commercial break?</p>\n<p>Luckily, time marches on. For most everyone under the age of 40, the evening\nnews is a distant memory. Nowadays, sophisticated paradigms of modernity that\nwe are, we get our news from the Internet. Streaming through our browsers and\nphones at all hours of the night and day, we have access to points,\ncounter-points, and sometimes even counter-counter-points. We would never be so\nsilly as to go searching under our kitchen sinks for the boogeyman. How quaint\nour forebears were!</p>\n<p>But hold on a second, what's this now? A celebrity has said something racist?\nRepublicans want to shackle all women to the kitchen stove? Investment bankers\nare skinning the poor and wearing their skins as suits? Why, this is outrageous!\nI ought to...well, certainly the first thing I ought to do is click on this link\nand read the article to learn all about it. And then, I must share it! With an\nappropriately witty rejoinder of my own, I could garner likes and retweets in\nthe dozens, if not hundreds!</p>\n<p>That was close. Racism has been solved. Women retain their freedom for another\nday. Social justice has been achieved. It's a good thing I was here, paying\nattention! Who knows what might have happened?</p>\n<p>Well, maybe we aren't so clever as we thought, after all. At the end of the day,\nwe're still being emotionally manipulated in order to sell advertising. Instead\nof fear, now it's anger. You're a good person. You don't want others to suffer\ninjustice. So, naturally, when you hear about it, you want to do something. But\nwhat have you done, really, by reading an article? Is that celebrity going to be\nless racist now? Are Republican legislators going to suddenly start supporting\nwomen's rights? It seems unlikely. So what's being accomplished here?</p>\n<p>I feel like I've gotten a little off track here. I want to make it clear that I\nacknowledge that the issues here are real problems. Racism, sexism, corporate\nmalfeasance, etc are all serious issues that need to be addressed. Just like the\nexample of the evening news, preventing your kid from drinking drain cleaner is\ndefinitely a legitimate concern to have. The problem is that the types of\narticles mentioned do absolutely nothing to address these issues. Rather, they\ncynically manipulate well-intentioned people to drive advertising revenue. In\nfact, if we ever did actually beat racism, sexism, etc. many of these \"news\"\norganizations would probably go out of business.</p>\n<p>Aside from all that, it's just physically exhausting to be angry all the\ntime. At some point, you just have to accept that there is pretty much a\nnever-ending supply of terrible shit going on in the world at any given time,\nand there's not a lot you can do about it. To that end, I recommend tuning out\nthose who would demand you focus your attention on this or that injustice, and\ninstead concentrate on things you can personally influence. Life's too short to\nlet strangers' profit motives rule your emotions.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2015-02-04","path":"/internet-odrome-iofs/","title":"Internet Outrage Fatigue Syndrome (IOFS)"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"KotSF"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
