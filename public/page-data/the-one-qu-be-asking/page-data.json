That sort of thing isn't usually my\nstyle. I'll cut right to the chase. The question is \"What percentage of classes\nare taught by full-time faculty?\". If you're already on board with why this is\nimportant and would like to get right to the juicy, juicy data,\n<a href=\"/adjunct/colleges.html\">have at it</a>. I've culled the information provided by US\nNews and World report so that it can be re-sorted by any of the available\nmetrics they have (including percentage of full time faculty). In the meantime,\nfor some insight as to why this is important, read on.</p>\n<p>Unbeknownst to the general public, academia is undergoing an identity\ncrisis. As tuition costs have skyrocketed, universities are being run more and\nmore like corporations. Two trends in particular will be very familiar to those\nin the corporate world - exorbitant management salaries, and labor cost-cutting\nvia replacing full-time, benefit-receiving employees with part-time, contract\nemployees. In academia this translates to hiring fewer and fewer tenured\nprofessors and increasingly relying on adjuncts to teach classes.</p>\n<h3>What is an adjunct?</h3>\n<p>Adjunct professors are usually hired on a class-by-class basis to\nteach a specific course. They are paid per course, and are only paid\nfor the time spent in the classroom, typically $2,500 - $4,000 per\ncourse. Traditionally, this was a way to allow people who held\nfull-time jobs to share their real world experience in a university\nsetting and earn a little extra income. Lately, these positions are\nused by recent and soon-to-be PhD graduates to cobble together a\nliving while they chase a shrinking pool of tenure-track teaching\npositions.</p>\n<h3>What does this mean for students?</h3>\n<p>Students should be the most concerned about the quality of instruction\nthey're receiving. While most adjuncts are extremely dedicated\nindividuals (indeed, they have to be to persevere in their fields\nwithout secure employment), they do not possess the resources that\ncome with a full professorship. As\n<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/05/the-cost-of-an-adjunct/394091/?single_page=true\">adjunct professors themselves warn</a>,\nthey are not provided with office space, making it difficult or\nimpossible to meet with students outside of class. Not being\nfull-time, permanent employees, adjunct professors have a limited\nknowledge of the university's curriculum and policies, rendering them\nunable to give advice to students about which courses to take to best\nmeet their educational goals. For students who plan on continuing on\nto a graduate degree, they may have difficulty getting letters of\nrecommendation when most of their classes have been taught by\nadjuncts. Since adjuncts are only hired on a per-semester basis, there\nis no guarantee that the professor they had last semester will be back\nnext semester. If they are able to get a letter of recommendation,\nstudents will find that a letter from an adjunct professor carries\nless influence with admissions committees than a letter from a tenured\nor tenure-track professor.</p>\n<h3>What can students do?</h3>\n<p>Another facet of the corporatization of the university is the transition of\nstudents into customers. Like any other corporation, the ability to win\ncustomers is the final arbiter of success for modern universities. To that end,\nstudents must vote with their wallets. Choosing a school based on their\nwillingness to employ full-time faculty will not only help to improve the plight\nof adjuncts everywhere, but also makes sense for the student hoping obtain the\nbest possible education for their tuition dollar.</p>\n<h3>How do I know which schools favor employing full time faculty?</h3>\n<p>Funny you should ask! As it happens, this data is included as part of the US\nNews and World report college rankings. However it does not currently figure\nvery heavily into the way they calculate their rankings. That's why I've taken\nthe liberty of compiling the data from US News into a list that is easily\nsortable by any of the component information that makes up the\nrankings. <a href=\"/adjunct/colleges.html\">Feel free to give it a try.</a> Universities\noften claim that these rankings are not meaningful (at least, the ones who don't\nget ranked as highly as they would like do), but the fact is, they matter. They\nare often the first place a student will look to begin evaluating colleges. As\nthe self-appointed arbiters of education quality, US News has an opportunity and\na responsibility to use their influence to push universities towards a higher\nstandard. Adjuncts have pushed for years to improve their situation, but it is\nunlikely universities are going to listen to them. Only when the exploitation of\nadjuncts starts to have a negative effect on their enrollment numbers and\ntuition revenue are universities going to start making changes.</p>\n<p>In addition to exposing the data surrounding percentage of full-time faculty at\neach university, I've also created a new metric called \"Professors per Dollar\"\nwhich is the ratio of full-time faculty at a school to the tuition cost. This is\nan attempt to determine which schools are providing the best value in terms of\nquality education. College tuition is one of the most expensive purchases you\nwill make in your life. As a student, you should be confident that your tuition\nmoney is paying for faculty resources to further your education and not\ninflating administrator salaries. </p>\n<p>Professors per dollar is not a perfect metric. It's skewed by schools with very\nlow tuition costs. The leading private university in this measure is Brigham\nYoung University, due simply to the fact that the tuition is heavily subsidised\nby the Mormon church. It may also be skewed by smaller schools, with a lower\nnumber of students and thus a lower number of professors overall (adjunct or\nnot). Since these schools do not typically come with a proportionally smaller\nprice tag, they do worse on this metric, because you're paying about the same\namount of money for access to fewer resources  than you would at a larger\nschool. Arguably this could be an accurate way to judge the value of a\nparticular school, but some students may find smaller schools to be a better fit\nregardless. </p>\n<p>I don't think any one metric is going to present perfect information for every\nstudent to choose a school that suits them best, but all sorts of information\nshould be made available so that students can make the most informed decision\npossible. Overall, I think a higher percentage of full-time faculty indicates\nthat a school places higher priority on providing a quality education rather\nthan inflating administrative salaries or building increasingly fancy buildings.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2015-07-06","path":"/the-one-qu-be-asking/","title":"The One Question Every Prospective College Student Should Be Asking"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"KotSF"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
