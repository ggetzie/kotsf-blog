I'm Gabriel Getzie, an electrical engineer by day and python programmer /
website designer by night in Washington, DC. 

What is this thing about anyway?

I mean this blog, not life in general, but maybe I'll get to that too. I read
somewhere once that all the successful blogs have a niche. "You've got to stick
to one topic and be the expert on it", they say "So your audience knows what to
expect".  This has always been a sticking point with me, although I see it borne
out in successful blogs by people who don't already have a
following. Regardless, I don't intend to stick to one thing. There's a lot of
things I'm interested in. As a result some posts will probably not be interest
to people who were interested in other posts. Ah, well. Such is life. Here's a
short, non-comprehensive list of things I may or may not write about:

* Philosophy - to include general thoughts on the meaning of life and the nature
  of reality, ethics, metaphysics, aesthetics, all that jazz.
  
* Personal finance - to the extreme. Such as how to retire early (or at least
  steps I am taking in that direction, as I certainly can't speak from
  experience. Yet.)
  
 * Programming - in particular, python, django, javascript
 
 * Machine learning / data science / Artificial Intelligence - This ties into
   the philosophy thing. I'm fascinated by how our minds work and how we can
   replicate them in software.
   
 * TV / Movie / Literary criticism - Not in any real serious way, but I read a
   lot, and watch maybe slightly more TV and movies than the next person. I have
   thoughts about them. I like to share them with people.
   
 * Politics, Current Events, Economics - Like anyone, I have opinions. Except
   mine are right ;)
   
So, if any of those things are interest to you stick around! You'll be sure to
find something you like sooner or later.
