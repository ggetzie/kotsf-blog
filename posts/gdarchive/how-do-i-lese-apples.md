I like them quite a lot, thank you. In fact, they're pretty great! Ever since my esteemed colleague over at [Killa Blog](http://kil22.blogspot.com/2009/04/and-all-that-jazz-apples.html) introduced me to Jazz apples almost a year ago, I've kept a close eye on the produce section at my local grocer. This past weekend a new challenger appeared.

It seems Australia, ever the bitter rival of New Zealand, is not content to let those lousy Kiwis dominate the world of boutique apple varietals. The [Pink Lady](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_lady_apple) is a bit more tart than the Jazz apple, but very very tasty. She'll be appearing in my own lunch bag at least until plums and nectarines are in season.
