Not to delve too deeply into a piece of comedy, but I think there's a kernel of
truth here. Just to be perfectly clear, I'm not here to argue in favor of or try
to justify slavery. Let there be no confusion about that.

As a thought experiment, let's imagine there are two farmers, John and
Mary. John and Mary are subsistence farmers. They work hard, make barely enough
food to keep themselves alive and have little time for leisure. For the sake of
argument, let's say it takes a solid 8 hour day of farming for Mary to make just
enough food to feed herself, and the same for John. The work is grueling and
leaves them exhausted. They have just enough time to take care of themselves,
enjoy some time with their families, and sleep before they have to get up the
next day and do it again.
