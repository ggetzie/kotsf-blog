There's something strange about Nixon. What are some other examples of real or fictional characters who were like him? He had the capacity for greatness, but he was undone by his own insecurity and paranoia. King Lear? Richard III? Macbeth? He feels Shakespearean. Are there Roman emperors who were similar? I know there's been a ton of media about Nixon already.

Frost/Nixon  
All the President's Men  
Dick  

But has anyone really captured the essence of Nixon? He's a tragic figure. His flaw wasn't hubris, it was the opposite. Impostor syndrome? Inferiority complex? He suffered from a lack of confidence, a lack of being able to trust his followers, or himself. He didn't believe he could win without cheating. He was too fearful.
