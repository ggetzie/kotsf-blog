Just what is it about The Great British Baking Show?

In case you haven't heard of this program, it's exactly what it sounds
like. It's a baking competition. The contestants are British. To me, it sounded
boring at first. But it's oddly compelling. Why though? Even if you aren't
particularly interested in baking, there's something about this show.

What people love about it is "it's just about the baking". It has a simplicity
that is missing in many other reality TV shows. And yet, there is a drama that
rivals anything else on television.

It seems like other reality shows go to great lengths to establish personalities
and drama among their contestants. The Great British Baking Show manages this
almost effortlessly through it's single-minded focus. By keeping the show
laser-focused on the baking, the personalities of the contestants come
through. It's a case study in "show don't tell".
