The world is open book. When you don't know the answer to something in real
life, you're supposed to find someone who does and ask them. How to translate
this to grading? What if kids were graded on how many of their peers' questions
they could answer? Set the bar so that kids who ask for help on every question
have the minimum passing grade and kids who answer every question get the
maximum grade. Encourage collaboration while still measuring knowledge.
