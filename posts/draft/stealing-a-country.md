Could you take down an evil regime by simply spiriting away its
citizens? I'm not talking about kidnapping. Look at North Korea, for
example. All available evidence indicates that it's an absolutely
horrible place to live. I wonder how many of the people living there
would leave given the chance? What if the US just parked some ships
off the coast or set up some camps along the border and granted
citizenship to anyone who wanted it?

Countries depend on having an ample supply of working age men and
women to help drive their economies. When the working age citizens
start to get outnumbered by the children and the elderly, the country
can get into deep demographic trouble as the producers of resources
get outnumbered by the consumers. Malcolm Gladwell
[explains the phenomenon](http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/08/28/060828fa_fact)
in an excellent article.

Supposing this radical immigration plan were put into action, who
would be the most likely people to take it up? It would likely be
young, working age people; the very same people countries depend on to
produce the goods and services that drive their economies. Every
economicaly productive person that America lures from elsewhere is a
boon to America and a blow to the country they come from. Every time a
worker leaves, the ratio of working to non-working citizens worsens.

This isn't about trying to destroy a certain country, per
se. Countries should be subjected to the same economic forces that
companies are. Is our way of life so great? If it is, how many people
would choose it? By freeing people to make these choices we can see
more easily which country is the most desirable. Decrease the friction
for people to move among countries and the countries that don't treat
their citizens well will wither and die.

lThis strategy is not without its risks. Cuba for example,
[deliberately deported](http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/mariel-boatlift.htm)
hundreds of criminals to the US during a mass migration.
