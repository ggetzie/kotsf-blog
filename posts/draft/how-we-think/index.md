When I was young people told me I was smart. I don't think there's a good way to
talk about that without sounding like I'm bragging, but there it is. The thing
is, I didn't really get *why* people thought I was smart. None of the things I
thought seemed particularly extraordinary to me, yet people insisted they were
exceptional in some way. As a result being a "smart person" became a large part
of my identity. This helped in some ways, and hurt in others. I won't go into a
great amount of detail, but suffice to say reading about [Carol Dweck's research](http://amzn.to/1kHHniB)
into growth mindsets versus fixed mindsets felt like reading my own biography,
as I'm sure it has for many formerly "gifted" children. 

Anyway, that's not what I want to talk about right now. The point is, I've spent
a lot of time thinking about what "smart" means, and what exactly our minds are
doing when it comes to this thing we call intelligence. After 30 some years, I
think I've maybe started to get a handle on it.

### What is it?

Let's say you see something you've never seen before. What's the first thing you
might ask? It's probably something along the lines of "What is it?". It's a
question so simple most people probably wouldn't give it a second thought, but
it exposes an important assumption we all make every day. This thing, whatever
it is, does not exist on its own. It is an instance of a class of things. 

This is, in a way, kind of odd. Here we have a vast universe with immense
amounts of matter swirling around and bumping into itself and combining together
and breaking apart in various ways over time. Why should any two clumps of
matter resemble each other except by chance? Yet, they do, of course. Not only
that, but they do so reliably that the lumps of matter in our heads respond in
predictable ways, creating thoughts that correspond to these phenomena.

General purpose thinking algorithm.

1. Sense a thing.  
2. Extract features\*  
3. Compare features to other known things.  
4. Place things with matching features in a group.  
5. Extrapolate additional features based on features present on other things in the group.  

Failures of this method:  
Cargo cults.
Racism/Sexism.  
Religion: aka - cargo cults.

Successes:  
Science.

The difference between failure and success is the rigor with which we include
things in groups and our willingness to re-evaluate a thing's membership in a
group based on new information.

Groups are inherently fictitious. The group is a construct of the mind. Flawed
reasoning supposes causality flows from group to individual rather than from
individual to group.
