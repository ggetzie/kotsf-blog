This election has blown my mind like nothing else ever has. Seriously, I feel
like I just woke up from the matrix. I'm still reeling and trying to process
everything that's happened. I didn't get it until after Trump won. I think a lot
of people still haven't gotten it. In the meantime I wrote this little
fable. It's not a true story, at least I don't think it is. I don't have any
evidence to say that it is. But there's just enough coincidences to think that
maybe, possibly, it might be.

Once upon a time there was a young woman named Hillary Rodham. She was very
smart and very ambitious and very idealistic. She grew up in Illinois, in a
suburb of Chicago and she decided that she wanted to help people, as much as she
could, for her whole life. She studied hard and went to a very good college and
from there to a very good law school. After that, she decided to move to
Arkansas, because that's where some of the poorest people were, who needed the
most help. She worked as a public defender and spoke for people who had no
voice. She fought to get healthcare for children who didn't have any. Along the
way she met a charming man named Bill and they fell in love and got married.

Bill was also very smart, and very idealistic, and very charismatic and
ambitious. Together they decided that they could help even more people if they
went into politics. Bill started running for office, and he started winning.

But running for office is very expensive. Soon Hillary and Bill decided that
they couldn't do it alone. They needed more money. So they went to find some
wealthy Donors who could help them out. They approached some Donors and told
them about all the wonderful things they wanted to do to help people. The Donors
said "That sounds wonderful! We'll help you do these great things. But, by the
way, there's a few other things too. Don't worry too much about them. They'll
help us create more jobs for everyone!"

Well, Bill and Hillary were never business people, but creating jobs sounded
good. So they went ahead and they won more elections and they helped more people
and before you knew it, Bill was running for President of the United States.

As it turned out, elections kept getting more and more expensive. And the Donors
kept asking for more and more favors. Hillary and Bill, being very smart,
started studying up on the things the Donors were asking for, and they started
thinking that maybe these wouldn't create so many jobs after all, and maybe
these were not so helpful to all the people they wanted to help. They decided
that maybe they didn't want to help do these things any more.

This made the Donors very angry. "If you won't do it, we'll find someone who
will! And *maybe* they'll want to undo all the helpful things you've done so
far!" The Donors went so far as to arrange for Bill to be impeached. Bill, you
see, while being very smart and very kind, was flawed, as all humans are. The
Donors knew this and exploited those flaws as best they could to try to turn the
people against him and Hillary. Hillary had had enough. She tried to speak
out. She told the people of a "vast conspiracy" against her and Bill. But, the
Donors owned the newspapers and the TV stations. When they wrote what she said,
they just laughed at her, and so everyone else did too. Bill managed to escape
the impeachment, somehow more popular than ever. But the damage was done. When
Bill and Hillary tried to send their friend Al to carry on their work, the
Donors sent two of their own to run against them. When the Donors lost the
election, they used all their resources to put their candidate in office
anyway. A dark time followed. 

For eight long years the Donors reigned, through wars and economic
turmoil. Finally, Hillary got another chance.
