Whether a single payer or other government run system is a more effective way to deliver healthcare to people is a different issue from whether or not it's a right. The evidence I've seen is that countries with more socialized systems spend less on healthcare per person than the US does, with roughly the same or better average life expectancy. 

That doesn't mean it's a right. What is a right, really? As a practical matter, you only have the rights you're capable of defending. There's nothing in the physical universe preventing anyone from abridging your right of free speech, or freedom of religion or anything else.
