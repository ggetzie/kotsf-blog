It's been a long time coming, but I think it's finally time for me
to shutter GreaterDebater. Suffice it to say, the site never
really gained much traction, except maybe among a small, but
dedicated group of spammers. I guess the demand for a site
specifically tailored for arguing on the Internet is not as high
as I had thought. Perhaps people are content to argue on the many
sites where it is only an ancilliary function. Perhaps I didn't
market as effectively as I could have. Probably some combination
of the above, and other factors.

At any rate, I want to free up the space on the server for new
endeavors, including this blog. The old posts from *That's
Debatable* have been ported to here and will remain accessible in
perpetutity in their own [archive](/gdarchive). Meanwhile, I will
plunge forward under the rebranded title you see now. I'm also
writing some new software to make the blog happen. I think the
database/web framework setup is somewhat overkill for my simple
blog. It also favors writing in a web form, which I never
liked. To that end the new blog is statically hosted, with some
simple scripts to convert markdown text to html, pass them through
a template and save to the web server root directly. The whole
thing is pushed to site with mercurial, which makes the workflow
nice for me. It also means I get to do all the writing in emacs,
and who wouldn't want that?

Aside from simplifying my blog life, I have another new project
that has been smoldering on the back burner for a couple years
now. It's time to finally bring that to the fore, so lookout for
more on that soon.

I hope everyone's new year is off to a great start. See you soon!
