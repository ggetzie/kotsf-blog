Apologies for the clickbaity headline. That sort of thing isn't usually my
style. I'll cut right to the chase. The question is "What percentage of classes
are taught by full-time faculty?". If you're already on board with why this is
important and would like to get right to the juicy, juicy data,
[have at it](/adjunct/colleges.html). I've culled the information provided by US
News and World report so that it can be re-sorted by any of the available
metrics they have (including percentage of full time faculty). In the meantime,
for some insight as to why this is important, read on.

Unbeknownst to the general public, academia is undergoing an identity
crisis. As tuition costs have skyrocketed, universities are being run more and
more like corporations. Two trends in particular will be very familiar to those
in the corporate world - exorbitant management salaries, and labor cost-cutting
via replacing full-time, benefit-receiving employees with part-time, contract
employees. In academia this translates to hiring fewer and fewer tenured
professors and increasingly relying on adjuncts to teach classes.

### What is an adjunct?

Adjunct professors are usually hired on a class-by-class basis to
teach a specific course. They are paid per course, and are only paid
for the time spent in the classroom, typically $2,500 - $4,000 per
course. Traditionally, this was a way to allow people who held
full-time jobs to share their real world experience in a university
setting and earn a little extra income. Lately, these positions are
used by recent and soon-to-be PhD graduates to cobble together a
living while they chase a shrinking pool of tenure-track teaching
positions.

### What does this mean for students?

Students should be the most concerned about the quality of instruction
they're receiving. While most adjuncts are extremely dedicated
individuals (indeed, they have to be to persevere in their fields
without secure employment), they do not possess the resources that
come with a full professorship. As
[adjunct professors themselves warn](http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/05/the-cost-of-an-adjunct/394091/?single_page=true),
they are not provided with office space, making it difficult or
impossible to meet with students outside of class. Not being
full-time, permanent employees, adjunct professors have a limited
knowledge of the university's curriculum and policies, rendering them
unable to give advice to students about which courses to take to best
meet their educational goals. For students who plan on continuing on
to a graduate degree, they may have difficulty getting letters of
recommendation when most of their classes have been taught by
adjuncts. Since adjuncts are only hired on a per-semester basis, there
is no guarantee that the professor they had last semester will be back
next semester. If they are able to get a letter of recommendation,
students will find that a letter from an adjunct professor carries
less influence with admissions committees than a letter from a tenured
or tenure-track professor.

### What can students do?

Another facet of the corporatization of the university is the transition of
students into customers. Like any other corporation, the ability to win
customers is the final arbiter of success for modern universities. To that end,
students must vote with their wallets. Choosing a school based on their
willingness to employ full-time faculty will not only help to improve the plight
of adjuncts everywhere, but also makes sense for the student hoping obtain the
best possible education for their tuition dollar.

### How do I know which schools favor employing full time faculty?

Funny you should ask! As it happens, this data is included as part of the US
News and World report college rankings. However it does not currently figure
very heavily into the way they calculate their rankings. That's why I've taken
the liberty of compiling the data from US News into a list that is easily
sortable by any of the component information that makes up the
rankings. [Feel free to give it a try.](/adjunct/colleges.html) Universities
often claim that these rankings are not meaningful (at least, the ones who don't
get ranked as highly as they would like do), but the fact is, they matter. They
are often the first place a student will look to begin evaluating colleges. As
the self-appointed arbiters of education quality, US News has an opportunity and
a responsibility to use their influence to push universities towards a higher
standard. Adjuncts have pushed for years to improve their situation, but it is
unlikely universities are going to listen to them. Only when the exploitation of
adjuncts starts to have a negative effect on their enrollment numbers and
tuition revenue are universities going to start making changes.

In addition to exposing the data surrounding percentage of full-time faculty at
each university, I've also created a new metric called "Professors per Dollar"
which is the ratio of full-time faculty at a school to the tuition cost. This is
an attempt to determine which schools are providing the best value in terms of
quality education. College tuition is one of the most expensive purchases you
will make in your life. As a student, you should be confident that your tuition
money is paying for faculty resources to further your education and not
inflating administrator salaries. 

Professors per dollar is not a perfect metric. It's skewed by schools with very
low tuition costs. The leading private university in this measure is Brigham
Young University, due simply to the fact that the tuition is heavily subsidised
by the Mormon church. It may also be skewed by smaller schools, with a lower
number of students and thus a lower number of professors overall (adjunct or
not). Since these schools do not typically come with a proportionally smaller
price tag, they do worse on this metric, because you're paying about the same
amount of money for access to fewer resources  than you would at a larger
school. Arguably this could be an accurate way to judge the value of a
particular school, but some students may find smaller schools to be a better fit
regardless. 

I don't think any one metric is going to present perfect information for every
student to choose a school that suits them best, but all sorts of information
should be made available so that students can make the most informed decision
possible. Overall, I think a higher percentage of full-time faculty indicates
that a school places higher priority on providing a quality education rather
than inflating administrative salaries or building increasingly fancy buildings.
