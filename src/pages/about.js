        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Gabriel Getzie, an electrical engineer by day and python programmer / website designer by night in Washington, DC. For the past several years (since 2008! Can you believe that? I hardly can) I designed and maintained GreaterDebater.com (now defunct). And now I'm writing this blog.
        </p>
        <p>
            What is this thing about anyway?
        </p>
        <p>
            I mean this blog, not life in general, but maybe I'll get to that too. I read somewhere once that all the successful blogs have a niche. "You've got to stick to one topic and be the expert on it", they say "So your audience knows what to expect". This has always been a sticking point with me, although I see it borne out in successful blogs by people who don't already have a following. Regardless, I don't intend to stick to one thing. There's a lot of things I'm interested in. As a result some posts will probably not be interest to people who were interested in other posts. Ah, well. Such is life. Here's a short, non-comprehensive list of things I may or may not write about:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Philosophy - to include general thoughts on the meaning of life and the nature of reality, ethics, metaphysics, aesthetics, all that jazz.
            </li>
            <li>
                Personal finance - to the extreme. Such as how to retire early (or at least steps I am taking in that direction, as I certainly can't speak from experience. Yet.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Programming - in particular, python, django, javascript
            </li>
            <li>
                Machine learning / data science / Artificial Intelligence - This ties into the philosophy thing. I'm fascinated by how our minds work and how we can replicate them in software.
            </li>
            <li>
                TV / Movie / Literary criticism - Not in any real serious way, but I read a lot, and watch maybe slightly more TV and movies than the next person. I have thoughts about them. I like to share them with people.
            </li>
            <li>
                Politics, Current Events, Economics - Like anyone, I have opinions. Except mine are right ;)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            So, if any of those things are interest to you stick around! You'll be sure to find something you like sooner or later.
